**About my teaching experience :**

> **Qualification** : \
> Computer engineer aggregation in 2023
>
> **Courses teached** :\
> oct 2024 - nov 2024 : Informatic TP (java), L1 at Diderot University, Paris \

**Why teaching is not an option ?**

> "As long as there are teachers, there is hope."\
> Teaching is one of the efficient way to guide societies but it's also an impossible job. Does it mean society is doomed ? Maybe, but I believe it will be it's it salvation.\
> Even the simplest things of life can be teached so, every day found something to learn from somoene and something to teach to someone, and every day feel happy.
