 I have to make my own personal page while waiting for Wikipedia to provide one...

 If you work for Wiki do not hesitate, I will help you by giving the basics :

> I was born the 31 march of 2000 in the city of Le Puy En Velay  and grow up to the village of Saint Jean de Nay, which makes me an "Auvergnat". When I was six we moove to Genille a village in Touraine, where I live until I left at 18 for studies, and that makes me a "Tourangeau". Now i'm working at INRIA Paris and I live in the 13th District so I guess now i'm a "Parisien" ! I you look for any advice for visiting any of thoose regions feel free to ask :] !
