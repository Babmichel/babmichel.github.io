 I have to make my own personal page while waiting for Wikipedia to provide one...

 If you work for Wiki do not hesitate, I will help you by giving the basics :

> I was born on March 31st 2000 in the city of Le Puy En Velay and I grew up in the village of Saint Jean de Nay, which makes me an "Auvergnat" ⛰️. When I was six we moved to Genille, a village in Touraine, where I lived until I left at 18 for my studies, and that makes me a "Tourangeau" 🏰. Now I'm working at INRIA Paris and I live in the 13th District of Paris so I guess now i'm a "Parisien" 🏛️! If you look for any advice for visiting any of those regions feel free to ask 🙂 !
