> Currently searching the best possible Differential MITM attacks on SKINNY 64-192 with MILP !

> Work in progress, don't worry and don't worry me, i'm a "force tranquille" ;).

# Thesis
> I am supervised by Dr Naya-Plasencia and Dr Derbez for "Optimizing cryptanalysis of symmetric primitives" with the funding of the ERC "SoBaSyC".\
> My goal is to encode some informatic tools in order to optimize the cryptanalysis of current symmetric primitives! For now I am focusing my self on coding a MILP tool to found optimize differential Meet in the Middle attacks. \
> I also look at the use of precomputed hash tables to improve cryptanalysis, specificaly how it can improve the key recovery of differential cryptanalysis.

# Conferences and Spring School
> * ### Mar 10-14, FSE Spring school, Roma 🇮🇹 :
> I attended FSE Spring Shcool organized by CASA, Ruhr-Universität Bochum. With lessons about :
>> - Boolean Function by Anne Canteaut
>> - Linear and Differential Cryptanalysis by Tim Beyne
>> - Automating Tools for symmetric-key Cryptanlysis by Maria Eichlseder
>> - Security of encryption modes by Bart Mennink
>> - Aritmetization oriented cryptanlysis by Leo Perrin
>
> * ### Mar 15 : First Workshop on Symmetric Key Cryptanalysis Automation and Modelling (SKCAM), Roma 🇮🇹 .
>
> * ### Mar 17-21 : 25th Fast Software Encryption Conferences (FSE), Roma 🇮🇹 .
> I didn't presented a paper but i hope that I was at least a good lion at the rump session 🦁
>
> * ### Mar 31 - Apr 04 : Codage and Cryptographie Days 2025 at Pornichet 🇫🇷
> I Presented my thesis subject and the state of my work at this time. [Slides](/.../main/assets/Presentation_Bastien_Michel.pdf){.btn .btn-success}
